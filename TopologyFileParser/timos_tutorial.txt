Files we saw:
=============

in topologyfilepaser svn:
(1) FileElement.h - basic abstract class for stuff you want to write out
(2) FileHandle.h - base node for xml 
(3) DataHandle.h - overloaded file handle that can store an array of crap
	- AttributeHandle and SimplificationHandle are instances of this
(4) SimplificationHandle.h - clan-family-simplificationhandle-> a particular simplificaiton sequence
	- indexes, birth-death stuff, hierarchy, etc.
(5) FeatureHierarchy.h - general implementation of a hierarchy - not related - simply to read in and deal with the file format - right now reads in simplificationhandle.h - but will probably also deal with statistics - vaidy for vis and janine for statistics in downstream tools

in streamingtopology:
(6)  FeatureFamily.h - EXAMPLE OF USING FILE FORMAT WITH MERGE TREE CODE
