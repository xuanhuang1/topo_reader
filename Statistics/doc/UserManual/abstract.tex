Topological analysis methods, such as the Reeb graph and the
Morse Smale complex, can be used to create multi-scale compact 
representations of scientific data. However, the interoperability 
of the existing methods with other analysis tools is lacking. This document describes
joint efforts by University of Utah, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and Sandia
National Laboratories to address this issue.  We introduce a unified output format based on the
notion of ``feature families''.  We present a series of compact downstream analysis 
tools whose input is this new file format and we provide details on their installation
and usage.
